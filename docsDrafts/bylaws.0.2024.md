# Endgame Declaration of Bylaws

Note: This is an Unofficial Document. This statement will be removed upon successful acceptance by the Clan Leadership.

## Preamble

This Document, upon agreement and commitment by the Clan Leads of Endgame, formally details the Process by which Endgame is to be Administered and outlines Guidance to all Members. The Document strives to create a Model for Governance that clearly defines and delineates Expectations, Responsibilities and Privileges as set forth by Endgame Leadership as the Clan executes its goal of maintaining Operational Excellence

## Leadership
### Leadership in Endgame is a Privilege and Responsibility.

#### Structure, Privileges and Procedures

The sum total of Leadership consists of two tiers: Clan Leads and Officers.
Jj
#### Clan Leads
> Six (6) Clan Leads are primarily responsible for the operation of the Clan with respect to any and all activities, though chief among them is the positioning of the Clan’s intent, posture, and performance within the Cycle of Strife.
> Clan Leads, solely, possess Voting Privileges and are responsible for making key decisions.
>> Key decisions consist of, but are not limited to: Member Acquisition, Member Termination, Promotion or Demotion of Leadership, Formation or Dissolution of Alliances, Amendments or Revisions to this Declaration.
> Clan Leads will vote in a designated thread, whenever possible, on all key decisions. No vote is deemed valid if it is rendered solely by voice, as such measures are not verifiable or archivable.
> Clan Leads, at their discretion, may appoint a Steward from the pool of Officers to *temporarily* act on their behalf. 
> In the capacity of Steward, an Officer will assume the Clan Lead's Voting Privileges. 
>> Actions of a Steward are reversible by a unanimous Clan Lead vote upon return of the formal Clan Lead.
> Clan Leads are the **final** authority on matters of discipline for inappropriate or disruptive behavior.
> Clan Leads will hear appeals in response to disciplinary actions only when there exists new, substantiated evidence that stands contrary to the decision against the disciplined.
> Appeals are granted by unanimous consent and deliberations regarding the potential reversal of disciplinary actions are public to all of Leadership.

#### Officers
> Endgame may possess no defined limit to members granted the Officer title. 
> Officers possess the Privileges of originating Proposals for discussions and, if necessary, vote by Clan Leads.
> Following the delivery of a Proposal, Officers are also permitted to participate in the deliberation along with the Clan Leads.
> Officers have the Responsibility of performing the tasks generated from Accepted Proposals, as deemed necessary by the Clan Leads, unless deemed outside their Responsibility scope by this document.
> Officers will assist the Clan Leads in the administrative tasks required to maintain Clan operations, excepting those with which require performance by the Clan Lead in possession of the in-game Clan Leader title.

#### All Members
> Membership in Endgame requires dedication to the various activities present within the scope of the Cycle of Strife. Inactivity, or insufficient participation, cannot be tolerated if the stated purpose of Operational Excellence is to be achieved.
> Periods of inactivity due to situations both planned and unplanned, will be addressed with Leadership through the appropriate avenues at the earliest opportunity. Failure to do so may result in removal from the Membership Roster.
> Endgame Members are expected to refrain from conduct that is disruptive or inappropriate. Excessive generation of conflict, within or external to Membership will be handled by Leadership, up to the maximum discipline of removal from the Clan, as voted upon by the Clan Leads.
> Members are entitled to propose to anyone within Leadership a requested Clan action. The Leadership is under no obligation to undertake the Proposal, nor are they committed to providing any Communication regarding the result of the Proposal.
> Members are entitled to a Formal Notification prior to being removed from the Membership Roster. There is no defined time that must transpire between the Notification and Removal.

### Amendments to this Document
Amendments can be proposed by any Clan Lead or Officer,  on behalf of themselves or a Member. 

_Note_: The following statement is a personal recommendation that I believe to be a sufficiently high hurdle, while it still maintains a sufficiently probable feasibility for implementing changes to our Guiding Document.

The process by which Amendments are Accepted requires, at minimum, a supermajority (greater than or equal to eighty (80) percent) of Clan Leads to vote in the affirmative. If a supermajority is not obtained, but the Proposed Amendment possesses a simple majority, the Vote is expanded to all Leadership Members. At the conclusion of that vote, if the Combined Leadership obtain a supermajority in the affirmative, the Proposal is Accepted.

_EndNote_: This is the conclusion of what I have written. There are plenty of other aspects with which we could explicitly develop procedures for, but at this point I believe it is sufficiently robust to begin the process of soliciting feedback regarding its content for revisions, consideration for implementation, or for the collective group to pan the idea and suggest something else. At the very least, this will get the conversation started and, believe me, I will be far from offended if it’s widely unpopular.
