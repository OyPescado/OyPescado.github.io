# Warband Embed

Our server hosts several Warbands with members across multiple clans. Any Warband with Endgame members can request a dedicated a space in the server for organizing and socializing!

If your Warband is hosted here, click the button below that corresponds to your group and you'll be given the proper role to access your channels!

# Warband Embed II

By default, all of the individual Warband channels are visible to anyone who requests the "Warbands" Role. This allows server members to assess whether they want fewer channels in their list or the opportunity to interact with the members of specific Warbands in smaller settings. If you would like to see all individual Warband channels, click the button below! (If you change your mind, click the button again!)

# Warband Embed III

Warband Leaders can request that their Warband channel be listed as completely private by restricting access to only individuals possessing that Warband's Role, or they can continue to allow anyone with the "Warbands" role to view their channel and participate in Voice. If, at any time, a Warband would like to have its channel privatized, please reach out to Oy!
