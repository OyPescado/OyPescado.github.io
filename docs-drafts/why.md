# Introduction

Welcome to the Endgame Discord Guild Server documentation. We are a top tier, competitive Diablo Immortal clan formed on the *Albrecht-Doombringer-The Last Vestige* server cluster. The following documentation will outline the architecture of the Guild Server in a *psuedo*-realtime fashion and will serve as both a means for replicating or recreating the Guild Server as well as an Electronic Audit Log for development efforts and issues/requests from the Guild Server/Clan population.
